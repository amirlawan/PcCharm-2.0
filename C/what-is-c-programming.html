                        <p>C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language fundamental to computer science since the early 1970s, created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Unlike higher-level languages, C provides programmers with direct access to memory and system resources, making it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and operating system development.</p>
                        <p>Think of C as a precise tool for directly communicating with a computer's hardware, providing a more efficient way to write code compared to languages like Python or Java.</p>
